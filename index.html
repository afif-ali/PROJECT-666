                <h2>Description:</h2>
                <p>PROJECT 666 is a passive agressive virus made with the sole purpose of bothering whoever uses it. After signing a contract with the devil with the help of LARRY, the virus takes over your computer, spamming you with empty windows, getting PETER GRIFFIN to demotivate you, or even throwing random jumpscares when you least expect it. After a while, GOD comes to you and bluescreens your computer... unless, you know the secret passcode to abort. CAN YOUR PC SURVIVE?</p>
